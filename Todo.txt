We are on the home stretch!  All major components are written.  All that's left is a lot
of tweaking and debugging.


*  Tweaking: add the following features to the GUI:
	^ A JLabel that counts how many cards that are in the pile.  Every time the client receives a
	PLAY_CARD command, the counter should increment.
	^ Removing players from the JTable in case of drops.
	^ (optional) A more obvious slap notification.  Perhaps a JLabel that appears over the cards
	that have been played?
	
*  Tweaking: add the following features to the server:
	^ (optional) Allow players to join in the middle of the game.
	^ (optional) Close the ServerSocket when the game ends
	
*  Right now, there is no certain way to punish inappropriate slapping.  Consider this a low
	priority problem, as we can get demoed without solving it.
	Proposals:
	^ Force the offender to lose two of his cards.  Unfortunately, this isn't effective if
	the offender does not have any cards to lose.
	^ Kick the offender out of the game.  Requires some quite annoying modification of the
	game model, GUI public methods, and protocol.
	^ Prohibit the offender from slapping.  Somewhat easier, as the server can just be set up
	to ignore slaps from the offender.
